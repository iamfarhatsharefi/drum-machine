# ✨  Dynamic Drum Machine

## Project Description 📝

The Dynamic Drum Machine is a fully interactive and responsive web application built using React and Bootstrap, designed to simulate a real drum machine. With a sleek and modern UI, it allows users to create beats using their keyboard or by clicking on the drum pads. The app is packed with custom audio clips, and it updates in real-time to reflect the drum pad being played. It offers a smooth and engaging user experience for both desktop and mobile users, passing all the requirements of the FreeCodeCamp Drum Machine project.
